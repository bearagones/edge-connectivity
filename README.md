# Edge Connectivity 

This program utilizes object-oriented programming and allows you to perform different algorithms and functions on various graphs (located in .txt files) such as: 
- Whether or not it contains a bridge (i.e., the graph becomes disconnected if a single edge is removed)
- Whether or not its spanning tree packing number is two (i.e. there are two-edge disjoint spanning trees)
- The edge connectivity (i.e. the minimum number of edges that can be removed before it becomes disconnected)
- The global min (i.e., the minimum number of paths between any two vertices)
- Kruskal's algorithm (i.e., the minimum spanning tree, where the spanning tree contains the smallest sum of the weights of the edges)

This application was made for my senior research project off verifying Palmer's Conjecture with the guidance of Professor Timothy Sun of San Francisco State University.
